Scale your entire UI design without hassle.

Button, image, font, everything is scaled automatically.

Design for one screen size, scale for all the others.

Before
- 250x250 square is the same size across devices

![Screenshots of the same design before scaling](/doc/Before.png "Screenshots before scaling")
  
After
- 250x250 square has two thirds the screen width across devices

![Screenshots of the same design after scaling](/doc/After.png "Screenshots after scaling")

- If we resize the screenshots above to be the same width
- then everything appears the same size
